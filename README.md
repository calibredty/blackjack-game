# blackjack-game 
This game is a simple, single player version of Blackjack. The object of the game is for the sum of the cards to be exactly 21. Every user starts with $100 in the pot. 
Clicking "Start Game" will display two numbers. If the number is less than 21 you may click "New Card" and another number will be displayed and added to the sum. If the number is not 21 you may add another card. 
If you get the desired score of 21, you "win", and 50 bonus chips will be added to your "pot". 
If you "bust" and your score is over 21 you will not be able to get a new card. You will, however, be able to click start game to start a new hand and try to get 21. 
Happy playing!
